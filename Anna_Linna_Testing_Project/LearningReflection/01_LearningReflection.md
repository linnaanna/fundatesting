# TODO

> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- I found the experience of testing the app very interesting and quite fun, actually.
  It was nice to put some of the theory I had learned into practice.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

- I simply tried to put myself in the user's shoes and think, how the user might try to e.g. log in with incomplete or incorrect information and how the app should then react. I always started from the "beginning" with only the prerequisites met and then went step by step, all the while trying to think what the user might see/do next.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management.

- This is a tough one, as I have no previous testing experience, so I can't really recommend anything. I'd maybe recommend Robot Framework for beginner testers because it is easy to understand.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- I have used mostly Visual Code but started out with Atom before that.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- I didn't really run into any problems.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

- No trouble. I have used GitHub before for various school projects, training projects at AW Academy and for showcasing my own hobby projects.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

- I would lean towards Robot Framework, simply because it strikes me as the most easy to use. The test cases are written in tabular form using keywords making the tests easy to read and understand even for a beginner like me. The drawback, as far as I understand, is that Robot Framework has trouble with complex test cases that require a high level of customization.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- What I found most job ads (in Finland at least) require from candidates was a relevant degree, previous experience, experience and knowledge of software testing methodologies and test automation, scripting experience (e.g. Python), excellent communication skills (english, Finnish or both), systematic approach to testing and teamwork skills.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

- I think I'm pretty set with the soft skills (systematic approach, teamwork skills etc.), but I don't have a relevant degree (yet) or any previous experience in testing. I should imagine that even junior positions would require at least the completion of some hobby projects for testing. My knowledge of testing methodologies and test automation would require some self-study just to make everything stick better. Maybe get a relevant certification to showcase my skills? I have some scripting experience in Python but again, I would propably have to practice more to get up to a better level. I also have pretty good communication skills in Finnish and English.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas?

-The project definately helped put some of the theoretical knowledge into practice and deepened my understanding of the subject. Some of the theory was quite, well, theoretical but the assignment was just the boost the end of the course needed. It was a really fun task and I think it demonstarted nicely what testing could be like in practice.
